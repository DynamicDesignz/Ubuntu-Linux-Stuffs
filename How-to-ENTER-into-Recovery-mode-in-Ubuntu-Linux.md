#### How to ENTER into Recovery mode in Ubuntu Linux 

Booting into recovery mode

1. Switch on your computer.

2. Wait until the BIOS has finished loading, or has almost finished. (During this time you will probably see a logo of your computer manufacturer.)

3. Quickly press and hold the `Shift key`, which will bring up the GNU GRUB menu. (If you see the Ubuntu logo, you've missed the point where you can enter the GRUB menu.)

4. Press Return and your machine will begin the boot process.
